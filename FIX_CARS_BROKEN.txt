# FIX FOR cars.py:
# The file has a broken duplicate function. Here's the quick fix:
#
# In VS Code:
# 1. Press Ctrl+G (Go to Line) 
# 2. Type: 297
# 3. Delete lines 297-301 that contain:
#    """
#    except Exception as e:
#        print(f"Get car error: {str(e)}")
#        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
#
# Then add this after line 141 (after def _deprecated_removed):
# ===================================
#     pass
#
#
# #  UPDATE CAR STATUS (Mark as sold out)
# @cars_bp.route('/cars/<car_id>/sold', methods=['PATCH'])
# ===================================
#
# Then restart: python app.py
